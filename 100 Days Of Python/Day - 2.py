# A comment is a useful tool which starts with '#'
# The lines in the code that are ignored by the interpreter during the execution of the program.
# It is used for reference for yourself or other people to know what is going on in your code. 

"""
You either use this key binding to comment
or use single quotations marks ('')
instead of double quotation marks
"""

# You could also use ctrl+/ command
# to uncomment as many lines
# you want

# We use \n for new lines in print command
# Just a reminder to don't use spaces if you use it. 
print("Hi!\nHow are you?!")

# You could also use comment like this
print("Hello World!") # Printing Hello World!

# If you wanted to use quotation marks in print statements,
# just use the \"(insert word)\"
print("I am \"fine\"")

# You could also add different values to print statement and those values are called objects
print(6, 9, "Nice!") #Printing the 3 objects

# You can also seperate those values with sep parameter
print(4, 2, 0, "Weed!", sep="-")

# There is also a parameter called "end" to specity what you gotta print at end
print("And", end=" Success!\n")

#There is also file parameter for objects with write method which we will discuss in future classes
# Also sep and end parameters are actually optional
