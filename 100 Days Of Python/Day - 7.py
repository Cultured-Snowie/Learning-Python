# 1 - We can use ' ' ' to print 2 or more lines 
# 2 - we can use escape sequence character  \"  to print ( " )  in string 
# 3 - Programming language count numbers from 0 , for example:
Name = "Snowie" 

print (Name[0])
print (Name[1]) 
print (Name[2]) 
print (Name[3]) 
print (Name[4])
print (Name[5])

print("\nLet's use the for loop instead to make things easier!\n ")
for character in Name: 
    print (character)
