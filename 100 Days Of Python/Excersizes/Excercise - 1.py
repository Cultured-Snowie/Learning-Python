# In this excersie, we are gonna build a Calculator.

# First we gonna need some variables to hold the data.
a = 60
b = -15

# Now we gonna assign variables for the answers to do diferent types of calculations.
# And use the print statement to generate the answers in output.
ans_1 = a+b
print("The addition of",a,"and",b,"gives us the sum as:",ans_1)

ans_2 = a-b
print("The subtraction of",a,"and",b,"gives us the difference as:",ans_2)

ans_3 = a*b
print("The multiplication of",a,"and",b,"gives us the product as:",ans_3)

ans_4 = a/b
print("The division of",a,"and",b,"gives us the quotient as:",ans_4)

ans_5 = a//b
print("The floor division of",a,"and",b,"gives us the approximate value as:",ans_5)

ans_6 = a%b
print("The modulus of",a,"and",b,"gives us the remainder as:",ans_6)

ans_7 = a**b
print("The exponential of",a,"in the power",b,"gives us the value as:",ans_7)
